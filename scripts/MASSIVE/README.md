These scripts run on the server side and are called by Strudel.

The concept here is that the server scripts do the grunt work and Strudel does not need to know about how desktop
sessions are delivered. This enables us to quickly respond to issues on the server side as they arise and not
pollute the Strudel client with unnecessary detail about scheduler quirks.

C5 (Centos 5) server side scripts are here (obsolete)

C6 (Centos 6) server side scripts are in the C6 dir
